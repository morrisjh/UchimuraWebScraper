# UchimuraWebScraper
A simple web scraper to extract data from Uchimura Kanzō's Denmarukukoku no hanashi on Aozora Bunko.

# UchimuraWebScraper.py
UchimuraWebScraper.py is a simple python program based partially on Brad Traversy's blogscraping.py (see: https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/f2014a236646ff62dccfc9fe5d469ed5).

It is designed to be used to web scrape a piece of writing by Uchimura Kanzō entitled Denmarukukoku no hanashi from the Japanese text database, Aozora Bunko. Users can use the web scraper to write Uchimura's text as well as some basic information about the text including title, subtitle, and author information to a .txt file.

The program uses bs4 (BeautifulSoup) and requests which should be installed using pip.

# Further Development
There are no plans to develop this further at present. It was made mostly for personal practice.
